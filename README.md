What's here:

* blackjack -- a simple blackjack program, implemented eight times in eight languages 

* gallery -- an image gallery learning project in Scala and Liftweb, based on dpp's image upload example

* mandelbrot -- a program to generate mandelbrot set images as PNG graphics files, implemented three times in three languages

* nondeterminism -- implementations of Paul Graham's nondeterminism examples
  from _On Lisp_ Chapter 22 in Ruby and C (the Ruby version has now been
  published as the `ambit' gem, with documentation and examples -- these are
  just the examples)
