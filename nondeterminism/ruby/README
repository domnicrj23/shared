This directory contains a ruby implementation of choose/fail nondeterministic
programming with branch cut, as described in Chapter 22 of Paul Graham's _On
Lisp_, along with the scheme examples of its use given therein.

This code will not work in JRuby or MacRuby (no callcc).  It should work in 1.9.2 with
minor changes (callcc has moved to the 'continuation' stdlib).

Due to Ruby containing a true call/cc, this is a much straighter port of
Paul Graham's scheme version of this code than his Common Lisp or my C
versions are.  :-)
