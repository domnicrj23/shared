This directory contains a ruby implementation of choose/fail nondeterministic
programming with branch cut, as described in Chapter 22 of Paul Graham's _On
Lisp_[1], along with the scheme examples of its use given therein, in examples.rb.

queens.rb contains an implementation of the N-queens problem, inspired by
the prolog version in _The Art of Prolog_[2]

This code will not work in JRuby or MacRuby (no callcc).  It should work in 1.9.2 with
minor changes (callcc has moved to the 'continuation' stdlib).

Due to Ruby containing a true call/cc, this is a much straighter port of
Paul Graham's scheme version of this code than his Common Lisp or my C
versions are.  :-)
