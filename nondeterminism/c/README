This directory contains a (currently partially working -- nested choose() is
broken) implementation of choose/fail nondeterministic programming, as
described in Chapter 22 of Paul Graham's _On Lisp_, along with two of the
scheme examples given therein... in C.

choose and fail are implemented as a pre-processor macros, choose() and a
function fail().  They have two important limitations as compared to their
scheme counterparts:

  a.) if the function which has called choose() returns, a subsequent fail()
      produces an undefined result.  In this sense, this implementation is
      closer to the Common Lisp choose-bind implementation given in section
      22.4.

  b.) choices must be specified from lowest preference to highest, instead
      of vice versa -- this simplifies the macros substantially
