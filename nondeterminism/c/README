This directory contains a implementation of choose/fail nondeterministic
programming, as described in Chapter 22 of Paul Graham's _On
Lisp_, along with two of the scheme examples given therein... in C.

choose and fail are implemented as pre-processor macros CHOOSE() and
FAIL().  They have one important limitation as compared to their scheme
counterparts -- if the function which has called CHOOSE() returns, a
subsequent FAIL() produces an undefined result.  In this sense, this
implementation is closer to the Common Lisp choose-bind implementation given
in section 22.4.

Branch cuts are not yet implemented.
