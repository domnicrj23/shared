This directory contains a (currently partially working) implementation of
choose/fail nondeterministic programming, as described in Chapter 22 of Paul
Graham's _On Lisp_, along with two of the scheme examples given
therein... in C.

choose and fail are implemented as pre-processor macros CHOOSE() and
FAIL().  They have two important limitations as compared to their scheme
counterparts:

  a.) if the function which has called CHOOSE() returns, a
      subsequent FAIL() produces an undefined result.  In this sense, this
      implementation is closer to the Common Lisp choose-bind implementation given
      in section 22.4.

  b.) choices must be specified from lowest preference to highest, instead
       of vice versa -- this simplifies the macros substantially

Branch cuts are not yet tested.
