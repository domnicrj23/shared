This directory contains the scheme implementation of choose/fail
nondeterministic programming with branch cut described in Chapter 22 of Paul
Graham's _On Lisp_, along with the scheme examples of its use given therein.

I've done nothing major with this code, just updated a few idioms, and
bundled it up as an R6RS compatible library module.

I've tested this with Petite Chez Scheme 8.0.
