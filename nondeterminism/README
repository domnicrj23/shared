This directory contains two implementations of choose/fail nondeterministic
programming with branch cut, as described in Chapter 22 of Paul Graham's _On
Lisp_[1].

The directory `scheme' contains Paul Graham's scheme implementation, with a
few tweaks to bring it into an R6RS world.

The directory `c' contains choose/fail and the scheme examples demonstrating
its use reworked in c, using a preprocessor macro for choose, and setjmp/longjmp.
