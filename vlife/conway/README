/*
 * life.c -- main routine for Conway's Life
 *
 * (This information is replicated in the file life.c)
 *
 * This and the accompanying files are a very simple implementation of
 * the game of Life, as described by Elwyn R. Berklekamp, John H.
 * Conway, and Richard Guy in _Winning_Ways_For_Your_Mathematical_Plays_
 * (New York:  Academic Press, 1982):
 *
 *		"Life Occurs on a virtual checkerboard.  The squares are called
 *		cells.  They are in one of two states:  alive or dead.  Each cell
 *		has eight possible neighbors, the cells which touch its sides or
 *		its corners.
 *		If a cell on the checkerboard is alive, it will survive in the
 *		next time step (or generation) if there are either two or three
 *		neighbors also alive.  It will die of overcrowding if there are
 *		more than three live neighbors, and it will die of exposure if
 *		there are fewer than two.
 *		If a cell on the checkerboard is dead, it will remain dead in the
 *		next generation unless exactly three of its eight neighbors are
 *		alive.  In that case, the cell will be born in the next
 *		generation."
 *
 * From this very simple set of rules, amazingly complex behavior develops.
 * 
 * The mac version of life has no command line options.
 *
 * Life starts in edit mode.  Use the following keys to move the '%'
 * cursor:
 *                          
 *                          k,8
 *                           ^
 *                           l
 *                  h, 4 <-- ¥ --> l,6
 *                           l
 *                           v
 *                          j,2
 *
 * Press <space> or <return> to toggle the current square.
 * To quit life, type 'q'.  To clear the screen, type 'c'.
 * To exit edit mode, type 'g'.  Life will then run until a key is pressed.
 * After being interrupted by a keypress, 'g' will continue the run, and 'e'
 * will return to edit mode. 
 *
 * To build this code for the macintosh, include the files generation.c,
 * life.c, thinkdisplay.c, thinkedit.c, thinkinit.c, thinkcallback.c,
 * and the <ANSI> library in a Think C project.
 * I recommend adding the lines:
 *		#define XMAX 90
 *		#define YMAX 30
 * to the project prefix (under options) as well.  See below for details.
 *
 * This version uses the Think C console interface.
 * It has only been tested with Think C 5.0, but should work with any
 * version thereafter, and possibly versions before.  A port to any other
 * compiler or platform would require a change in the code which uses the
 * Think C console interface.  All such code is isolated in the files
 * beginning with 'think'.  To produce a version for another platform or
 * compiler, you will need to code the following functions:
 *
 *		void	init (int *Argc, char ***Argv);
 *		int		edit (int which);
 *		void	display (int which);
 *		int		callback (int turn, int current);
 *
 * See the files think* for details.
 *
 * Also note that the size configuration constants in life.h are designed to
 * be overridden by each specific build.  See above for good values for the
 * Think C console...
