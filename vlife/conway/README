This and the accompanying files are a very simple implementation of the game
of Life, as described by Elwyn R. Berklekamp, John H.  Conway, and Richard
Guy in _Winning_Ways_For_Your_Mathematical_Plays_ (New York: Academic Press,
1982):

	"Life Occurs on a virtual checkerboard.  The squares are called
	cells.  They are in one of two states: alive or dead.  Each cell has
	eight possible neighbors, the cells which touch its sides or its
	corners.

	If a cell on the checkerboard is alive, it will survive in the next
	time step (or generation) if there are either two or three neighbors
	also alive.  It will die of overcrowding if there are more than
	three live neighbors, and it will die of exposure if there are fewer
	than two.

	If a cell on the checkerboard is dead, it will remain dead in the
	next generation unless exactly three of its eight neighbors are
	alive.  In that case, the cell will be born in the next generation."

From this very simple set of rules, amazingly complex behavior develops.

Life starts in edit mode.  Use the following keys to move the '%' cursor:
                         
                         k,8
                          ^
                          l
                 h, 4 <-- ¥ --> l,6
                          l
                          v
                         j,2

Press <space> or <return> to toggle the current square.

To quit life, type 'q'.  To clear the board, type 'c'.

To exit edit mode, type 'g'.  Life will then run until a key is pressed.

After being interrupted by a keypress, life will return to edit mode.

This code was originally written in 1995, using Think C for MacOS 7, with
the display code written using the Think C console interface.  I've started
playing with this again in late 2010.
