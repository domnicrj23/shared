This directory contains updated versions of some very old (1995) little
programs I wrote to play with various virtual life sims.  The originals were
written for MacOS 7, using Think C, and I'm slowly converting these to a
more modern environment.  What's here:

  conway -- John Conway's `game of life'.  Not yet fully converted from Think C.

  misc -- two smaller programs (Langton's `virtual ant', and Wolfram's
       	  one-dimensional cellular automaton).  Fully converted.
