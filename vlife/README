This directory contains updated versions of some very old (1995) little
programs I wrote to play with various virtual life sims.  The originals were
written for MacOS 7, using Think C, and I've converted these to use curses.
These are:

  conway -- John Conway's `game of life'

  misc -- two smaller programs (Langton's `virtual ant', and Wolfram's
       	  one-dimensional cellular automaton)
